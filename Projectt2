The narrative visualization expands on Project 1. It tells the story of general aviation safety over several decades. 
My question is: Has safety improved over this period or has it declined? 

I will present an overview of accidents and relevant facts through several visualizations and establish connections 
between them through a unifiying narrative. I will try to determine if the data shows a chain of causally related events that 
would lend themselves to a storytelling structure in which the readers uncover new layers until the resolution is reached.


Data Source 
My data source is Kaggle.com: AviationData.csv. 
This is a dataset from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Accident/Incident Database 
providing details about each aviation accident that has occurred from 1962 to the present.
