The narrative visualization expands on Project 1. It tells the story of general aviation safety over several decades. 
My question is: Has safety improved over the period or has it declined? 

Data Source 
My data source is Kaggle.com: AviationData.csv. 
This is a dataset from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Accident/Incident Database 
providing details about each aviation accident that has occurred from 1962 to the present.
