Week 1 Assignment:
	•	Replicate the process for your own dataset. This will involve finding/creating a suitable dataset, saving it somewhere in your repository, and writing the code. You should leverage the files present in the root of this directory (tutorial1_intro/ index.html, style.css, main.js)
	•	Update the table's conditional formatting to highlight something meaningful for your new dataset. This may include changing the logic for the cell's class, adding another attribute, or directly augmenting the cell's style.
BONUS:
	•	Add logic to update the appearance of an entire row (not just a single cell).
	•	Add a summary row for totals/averages of your data.


Problem:
In main.js, at the very bottom, I need to change the conditional formatting (attribute) to color rows:
	•	Less than 3, green
	•	Greater than 3, red
	•	Dates, grey

OR

I can do the extra credit and make a row and date the same color, dictated by the number in column B
